# Julia Jewels: Visual Exploration of Julia Sets

Julia sets are Mandelbrot Setâ€™s Less Famous Sibling. Out of the many intersections between art and science, fractals to me are perhaps the most elegant. 
There is just something mysteriously attractive about the purity, complexity, interconnectedness, and underlying truth of it all. Code has been adapted for better
visualization and color scheme. Play around with C in the code, the Julia set has a rich and complex set of dynamics. This can be explored by changing the value of c!
This was my favourite ~ Nitin
